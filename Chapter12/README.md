# Manual vs Automated Testing

## What is Manual Testing?

**Definition:**
Manual testing is a process where testers manually execute test cases without the use of automation tools. It involves evaluating the software's functionality, usability, and overall performance by manually interacting with the application.

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility:** Testers can easily adapt to changes in requirements.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Allows for intuitive and exploratory testing that can uncover unexpected issues.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Testers can provide immediate feedback on the user experience.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Time-Consuming:** Manually executing test cases can be very time-consuming.
- **Error-Prone:** Increased likelihood of human error during test execution.
- **Not Reusable:** Manual tests are not easily reusable for regression testing.

## What is Automated Testing?

**Definition:**
Automated testing involves using automation tools to execute pre-scripted tests on the software. It is primarily used for repetitive and regression testing tasks to ensure that the software performs consistently across different builds and versions.

**Advantages:**
- **Efficiency:** Faster execution of tests compared to manual testing.
- **Reusability:** Automated test scripts can be reused for multiple test cycles.
- **Accuracy:** Reduces human error and increases test accuracy.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Initial Setup Cost:** Requires investment in automation tools and script development.
- **Less Exploratory:** Limited ability to perform exploratory testing.
- **Maintenance:** Requires ongoing maintenance of test scripts to keep up with changes in the application.

## Comparison

| Aspect               | Manual Testing                             | Automated Testing                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Execution Speed      | Slower, dependent on tester's pace         | Faster, dependent on the automation tool |
| Accuracy             | Prone to human error                       | High accuracy, minimal human error       |
| Initial Investment   | Low, only requires skilled testers         | High, requires tools and script development |
| Flexibility          | High, adaptable to changing requirements   | Low, scripts need to be updated for changes |
| Exploratory Testing  | Excellent for discovering new issues       | Limited capability for exploratory testing |
| Reusability          | Low, not suitable for regression testing   | High, suitable for regression testing    |
| Cost Over Time       | Higher due to manual effort                | Lower in the long run due to automation |

## Sample Scenarios

### Sample 1: User Login

**Manual Testing:**
1. Tester navigates to the login page.
2. Tester enters valid username and password.
3. Tester clicks the "Login" button.
4. Tester verifies if the user is redirected to the dashboard.

**Automated Testing:**
1. Script navigates to the login page.
2. Script enters valid username and password.
3. Script clicks the "Login" button.
4. Script verifies if the user is redirected to the dashboard using assertions.

### Sample 2: Shopping Cart Functionality

**Manual Testing:**
1. Tester adds an item to the shopping cart.
2. Tester verifies the item count in the cart.
3. Tester removes the item from the cart.
4. Tester verifies the cart is empty.

**Automated Testing:**
1. Script adds an item to the shopping cart.
2. Script verifies the item count in the cart.
3. Script removes the item from the cart.
4. Script verifies the cart is empty using assertions.

### Sample 3: Form Validation

**Manual Testing:**
1. Tester fills out a form with valid data.
2. Tester submits the form.
3. Tester verifies if the success message is displayed.
4. Tester fills out the form with invalid data.
5. Tester submits the form.
6. Tester verifies if the appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Automated Testing:**
1. Script fills out the form with valid data.
2. Script submits the form.
3. Script verifies if the success message is displayed using assertions.
4. Script fills out the form with invalid data.
5. Script submits the form.
6. Script verifies if the appropriate error messages are displayed using assertions.
