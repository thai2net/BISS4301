# Scrum & Test Practice

## Scrum Overview

**Definition:**
Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed to promote collaboration, accountability, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal.

**Key Roles:**
- **Product Owner:** Defines the product backlog, prioritizes features, and ensures the team delivers value to the business.
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the Scrum process, helps the team adhere to Scrum practices, and removes impediments.
- **Development Team:** A cross-functional group responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments of the product at the end of each sprint.

**Key Artifacts:**
- **Product Backlog:** A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes.
- **Sprint Backlog:** A list of tasks the team commits to completing during the sprint.
- **Increment:** The sum of all completed product backlog items during a sprint and previous sprints.

**Key Events:**
- **Sprint:** A time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) during which the team works on selected product backlog items.
- **Sprint Planning:** A meeting to plan the work to be performed during the sprint.
- **Daily Scrum:** A short, daily meeting for the team to synchronize activities and plan for the next 24 hours.
- **Sprint Review:** A meeting to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** A meeting for the team to reflect on the past sprint and identify improvements for the next sprint.

## Test Practices in Scrum

**1. Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- **Definition:** A development approach where test cases are written before the code itself. This ensures that code is only written to pass the tests.
- **Steps:**
  1. Write a test for the next bit of functionality to be added.
  2. Write the minimal code necessary to pass the test.
  3. Refactor the code to ensure it is clean and maintainable.

**2. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
- **Definition:** An extension of TDD that focuses on the behavioral specification of software. It involves collaboration among developers, testers, and business stakeholders.
- **Steps:**
  1. Define behavior in a formalized language like Gherkin.
  2. Write automated tests based on the defined behavior.
  3. Develop code to pass the automated tests.

**3. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD):**
- **Definition:** Similar to BDD, ATDD involves writing acceptance tests before coding begins. These tests represent the expected behavior from the user's perspective.
- **Steps:**
  1. Collaboratively define acceptance criteria for user stories.
  2. Write acceptance tests based on the criteria.
  3. Develop code to pass the acceptance tests.

**4. Continuous Integration (CI):**
- **Definition:** A practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, often multiple times a day. Each integration is verified by automated tests to detect errors quickly.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces integration problems.
  - Allows for early detection of defects.
  - Encourages frequent testing and feedback.

**5. Continuous Delivery (CD):**
- **Definition:** An extension of CI, CD ensures that code changes are automatically tested and prepared for release to production.
- **Benefits:**
  - Faster and more reliable releases.
  - Reduced manual intervention in the deployment process.
  - Ensures that the software can be released at any time.

**6. Exploratory Testing:**
- **Definition:** A hands-on approach where testers actively explore the software, often without predefined test cases. This allows for the discovery of unexpected issues.
- **Benefits:**
  - Identifies issues that automated tests may miss.
  - Encourages creative and critical thinking.
  - Provides immediate feedback to the development team.

## Integration of Testing in Scrum

1. **Definition of Done (DoD):**
   - Includes criteria such as code reviews, unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests to ensure quality.
   
2. **Test Planning:**
   - Test planning is integrated into sprint planning to ensure that testing activities are part of the sprint backlog.

3. **Automation:**
   - Automated tests are created for new features to ensure regression testing is efficient and effective.

4. **Collaboration:**
   - Continuous collaboration between developers, testers, and the product owner ensures that testing is aligned with business requirements.

5. **Feedback Loops:**
   - Regular feedback from testing activities during the sprint helps the team make adjustments and improvements in real-time.
